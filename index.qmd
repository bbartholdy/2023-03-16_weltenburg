    Dental calculus is increasingly used by researchers to reconstruct dietary patterns in past populations. Common methods used to extract this information from dental calculus include microscopic identification of plant microremains, and detection of plant DNA and proteins. The ability of these methods to successfully detect objects of dietary origin has been extensively demonstrated in recent decades; however, less attention has been devoted to potential biases occurring during life, inhumation, exhumation, and processing, that may affect our interpretations. We know that plant (and other) microremains become trapped within the calculus matrix during consumption, and that we can dissolve the calculus to identify the source of the debris. But what do we actually know about the process in which dietary debris becomes trapped and preserved in dental calculus? How does this process affect our interpretations based on the target dietary components?

    To explore these questions, we have been developing an oral biofilm model to grow artificial dental calculus, and use the model to explore various processes involved in the incorporation and retention of dietary starches in dental calculus. The mineral and bacterial composition of the model was compared to human dental calculus to assess its validity as a proxy. The mineral composition and crystallinity is comparable to dental calculus, consisting in large part of carbonated hydroxyapatite, the main component in human dental calculus. The microbial composition of the model has a strong oral signature, though differs from the comparative human dental calculus in species composition and overall diversity. We also subjected the model calculus to known quantities of raw wheat and potato starch solutions, and compared the input starches to the recovered starches following extraction with a common archaeological extraction method. Granule counts recovered from the model calculus were considerably lower than the input (0.064% to 0.161% of starches recovered). We further found that large granules (>20 μm) were consistently underrepresented in model calculus samples that were subjected to both types of starches.

    Our initial results suggest that starch granules extracted from dental calculus may show a limited, biased picture of the overall starch consumption. More fundamental testing is needed to explore these potential limitations, and oral biofilm models provide a capable framework that can answer fundamental questions about diet and dental calculus in the past.

Methods-testing not possible on archaeological samples
- How do we validate output if we don't know the input?

How do dietary components end up in dental calculus in the first place?

Dental plaque is an example of an oral biofilm.

# Our model {background-color="#d1295a"}

## Intro

We developed a protocol oral biofilm model to grow artificial dental calculus.

. . .

A couple of questions we needed to answer:

- Does the protocol work?
- Are we actually growing dental calculus?
- What can we say about archaeological dental calculus and diet?

## What can't we do with it?

<!-- limitations -->

Use it to replace *in vivo* studies

- modern humans with documented intake (ethnographic studies)
- non-human primates with documented intake
- studies using intraoral devices

Simulate mastication and natural dental calculus formation

Directly compare with specific archaeological individuals and processes

- model has 'unnatural' growth

# Summary {background-color="#ab1866"}


## {.center}

The archaeological record is biased... [but how exactly?]{.fragment}

. . .

It's important to also deconstruct past dietary practices

. . .

And critically examine the methods we use

. . .

From multiple angles

. . .

To better understand why we see what we are seeing

> Analyzing the calculus is complex
  And not all samples yield effects
  The composition can be influenced, it's true
  By factors like diet, hygiene, and more that we construe

> So let us cherish what we can glean
  From dental calculus, so pristine
  But also be aware of its limits, dear friends
  And continue to explore new scientific trends.
