What substances are currently used to reconstruct diet in the past?

Paleodietary reconstruction is the process of reconstructing the diets of past societies based on various sources of evidence. Here are some substances that are commonly used to reconstruct diet in the past:

    Stable isotopes: Stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen are commonly used to reconstruct past diets. The isotopic composition of these elements in bone and teeth can provide information about the types of foods consumed and the relative amounts of these foods in the diet.

    Dental calculus: Dental calculus, or tartar, can provide a wealth of information about the foods consumed by past societies. By analyzing the proteins, fats, and other biomolecules trapped in dental calculus, researchers can reconstruct the types of foods consumed, as well as the seasonality of these foods.

    Coprolites: Coprolites, or fossilized feces, can provide direct evidence of the foods consumed by past societies. By analyzing the contents of coprolites, researchers can identify the types of foods consumed, as well as the presence of parasites and other pathogens.

    Archaeobotanical remains: Archaeobotanical remains, such as seeds, pollen, and phytoliths, can provide information about the plants consumed by past societies. By analyzing these remains, researchers can reconstruct the types of plants consumed, as well as the seasonality of these plants.

    Zooarchaeological remains: Zooarchaeological remains, such as bones and teeth of animals, can provide information about the types of animals consumed by past societies. By analyzing these remains, researchers can reconstruct the types of animals consumed, as well as the seasonality of these animals.

What are the limitations with those methods?

While the methods mentioned above are useful for reconstructing the diets of past societies, there are some limitations to each of these methods:

    Stable isotopes: Stable isotopes can provide information about the types of foods consumed, but they cannot provide information about the specific foods consumed. In addition, the isotopic composition of bone and teeth can be influenced by factors other than diet, such as geography and climate.

    Dental calculus: Dental calculus can provide a wealth of information about the foods consumed, but it only preserves in individuals who had sufficient calculus build-up, and it may not represent the overall diet of a population.

    Coprolites: Coprolites can provide direct evidence of the foods consumed, but the preservation of fecal matter is rare, and it may not reflect the overall diet of a population.

    Archaeobotanical remains: Archaeobotanical remains can provide information about the plants consumed, but they may not reflect the overall diet of a population, as some plants may not have left a recognizable record in the archaeological record.

    Zooarchaeological remains: Zooarchaeological remains can provide information about the animals consumed, but they may not reflect the overall diet of a population, as some animals may not have been hunted or raised for food.

Overall, each of these methods has its own limitations, and it is important to use multiple lines of evidence to reconstruct the diets of past societies.

Can you elaborate on the limitations of dental calculus?

Dental calculus is an important source of information about the diets of past societies. However, there are some limitations to its use in paleodietary reconstruction. Some of the main limitations of dental calculus include:

    Preservation: Dental calculus only preserves in individuals who had sufficient calculus build-up during life. This means that not all individuals in a population may be represented, and those who are represented may not be representative of the overall population.

    Variability: The composition of dental calculus can vary depending on a number of factors, such as age, sex, and health status. This can make it difficult to compare results across different individuals or populations.

    Recovery: Dental calculus can be difficult to recover, particularly from ancient skeletal remains. The process of removing calculus from teeth can also be time-consuming and labor-intensive.

    Contamination: Dental calculus can be contaminated by microorganisms from the environment, as well as by handling during the excavation and analysis process. This can make it difficult to accurately identify the biomolecules within the calculus.

    Interpretation: The interpretation of dental calculus data can be complex. For example, the presence of certain biomolecules in calculus may not necessarily indicate the consumption of a particular food, as these biomolecules can also be present in other types of materials.

Despite these limitations, dental calculus is still a valuable source of information about the diets of past societies. When combined with other lines of evidence, it can help to provide a more complete picture of what people ate in the past.

What can we do to address these limitations?

There are several ways to address the limitations of dental calculus in paleodietary reconstruction:

    Selection criteria: Careful selection of individuals who are likely to have significant calculus build-up can help to ensure that the sample is representative of the population of interest. Factors such as age, sex, and occupation can be used to identify individuals who are more likely to have significant calculus build-up.

    Standardized protocols: The use of standardized protocols for the recovery and analysis of dental calculus can help to ensure consistency across different samples and researchers. This can help to minimize the potential for contamination and variability in the results.

    Multi-proxy approach: Using multiple lines of evidence, such as stable isotopes and zooarchaeological remains, can help to corroborate the results obtained from dental calculus analysis. This can help to address some of the limitations of dental calculus and provide a more complete picture of past diets.

    Replication and validation: Replicating analyses on different individuals or populations and validating the results against other lines of evidence can help to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results.

    New technologies: The development of new technologies for the analysis of dental calculus, such as proteomics and metagenomics, can help to provide more detailed and accurate information about the diets of past societies.

By addressing these limitations, researchers can improve the accuracy and reliability of paleodietary reconstructions based on dental calculus analysis.

What about experimental validation?

Experimental validation can also be used to address some of the limitations of dental calculus in paleodietary reconstruction. This involves conducting controlled experiments to test the validity of the biomolecules identified in dental calculus as indicators of specific dietary components.

For example, researchers could compare the biomolecules identified in dental calculus from individuals with known diets to those from individuals with unknown diets to see if they match. This can help to confirm that the biomolecules identified in dental calculus are indeed indicators of specific dietary components.

Similarly, researchers could conduct experiments to determine how different factors, such as age, sex, and health status, affect the composition of dental calculus. This can help to identify potential sources of variability in the results and develop strategies to address these sources of variability.

Experimental validation can also be used to test the accuracy and reliability of new technologies for the analysis of dental calculus, such as proteomics and metagenomics. By comparing the results obtained using these new technologies to those obtained using more established methods, researchers can determine if the new technologies are providing accurate and reliable results.

Overall, experimental validation can help to improve the accuracy and reliability of paleodietary reconstructions based on dental calculus analysis and provide more confidence in the results.

And what about oral biofilm models?

Oral biofilm models can also be used to address some of the limitations of dental calculus in paleodietary reconstruction. These models involve growing microbial communities in the laboratory under controlled conditions to simulate the development of dental biofilms in the oral cavity.

By analyzing the composition of these biofilms, researchers can identify the biomolecules that are produced by the microbial community in response to different dietary components. This can help to identify specific biomolecules that are indicative of certain dietary components and confirm their presence in dental calculus from archaeological samples.

Oral biofilm models can also be used to test the effects of different factors, such as diet and environmental conditions, on the composition of dental biofilms. This can help to identify potential sources of variability in the results and develop strategies to address these sources of variability.

In addition, oral biofilm models can be used to test the accuracy and reliability of new technologies for the analysis of dental calculus, such as proteomics and metagenomics. By comparing the results obtained using these new technologies to those obtained using oral biofilm models, researchers can determine if the new technologies are providing accurate and reliable results.

Overall, oral biofilm models can provide valuable insights into the formation and composition of dental biofilms and help to improve the accuracy and reliability of paleodietary reconstructions based on dental calculus analysis.
